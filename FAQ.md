# Frequently Asked Questions

## Questions

### Is this community ONLY for Black People?

We say the community is meant to extend the Python community to communityies of Black and Colo(u)red Pythonistas of all skill levels.

We understand that [Blackness and Colourism is a construct that has been often use to segregate or diminish melanated individuals and doesn't always match a person's self-identity](https://blackpythondevs.com/2024-05-22-why-we-use-colored-and-coloured/). We allow folks from all walks to join and identify in their blackness as they see appropriate. 

### Is this community NOT WELCOME to anyone?

The only folks that are asked to leave the community are those that join with the intent of violating our [CODE of CONDUCT](https://github.com/BlackPythonDevs/.maintainers?tab=coc-ov-file#readme)

### Is this a religious or politically backed group?

No, this community does not align directly with any religious or political group. People of all religions and political beliefs are able to join and participate IN ACCORDANCE TO OUR [CODE OF CONDUCT](https://github.com/BlackPythonDevs/.maintainers?tab=coc-ov-file#readme).

### Where is Black Python Devs Based?

We are registered as a non-profit in the United States of America as a fiscal sponsoree of the GNOME Foundation.

### Does Black Python Devs has resources for beginners?

We have some partnerships that give us access to beginner resources but we (currently) do not author any content that would allow us to support beginners with a learning program.

### Does GNOME run this community?

**NO** GNOME is our fiscal host which means they assist in issuing payments in accordance to our programs and policies. The only time in which GNOME may jump into our affairs without us asking is if we are trying to spend money that we don't have or spending money in a way that violates our non-profit status in the United States.

### Does Black Python Devs meet in person?

This is something that is currently in development. Be sure to keep an eye on our [Meetup.com page](https://www.meetup.com/pro/black-python-devs/).

### Does Black Python Devs support existing meetups?

Yes Black Python Devs hopes to support meetups out in the world. Meetups that are in areas with concentrations of Black developers, we hope to support those local leaders. In areas hoping to attract more Black Pythonistas, we often hope to establish a support system that includes local Black tech leaders in the area that can help identify the best course of action in supporting that area.

### Does Black Python Devs support conferences?

Yes! Black Python Devs works with conferences to help make them safer, more accessible and equitable to Black audiences. Sometimes this is in the form of monetary support in exchange to help a group of Black Pythonistas attend the event and sometimes this comes in the form of consulting the leadership team. It is often determined based on the location and size of the event, the organizing team and their needs, and the opportunities available to provide meaningful support to the Black community in the area.

### Does Black Python Devs send money to developers to attend conferences?

At the present time, Black Python Devs will not send money directly to individuals unless they are awarded a grant in conjunction with a Black Python Devs event. If possible, Black Python Devs will attempt to work with third-party vendors to ensure awards are used in accordance to the grant plans.

## Are there countries that Black Python Devs will not work in?

With Black Python Devs being an US Non-Profit, we are barred from working with some [countries and entities based on the US Sanction System](https://ofac.treasury.gov/sanctions-programs-and-country-information)
